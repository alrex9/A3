High Level Design
	This module is meant to signify how our domain model is mapped to an API service which provides management for information
	on classes, students and files. When implemented in coordination with a database the client could use this interface to 
	retrieve processed data and make requests to add information to be processed and indexed by other components.

Use Cases
	1) Request file from classes and users: Clients can requests specific files by asking our module for the file based on id.
	2) Add a file a class or user: Clients could post to our module to add a file to their class or personal page.
	3) Add users to classroom: Clients can make requests containing student information to add a user to a classroom. 
	   this gives them permission to access the files within the specified class.
